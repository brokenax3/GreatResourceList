# Great Resource List

The goal of the resource list is to :

- Provide a searchable resource without having to search on the internet.
- Easy access to different topics.
- Organized content to show the concepts.

The main issue is to somehow have a good way to index files and prevent duplicate content. The spacing after headers might be messy due to the way markdown is converted into a pdf by pandoc.

This might not be useful for a lot of people but will be an easier way to refresh on content rather than
blindly searching for content online.
